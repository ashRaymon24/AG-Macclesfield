                            <p>
                                “For God is not unjust. He will not forget how hard you have worked for Him and how you have shown your love to Him by caring for other believers, as you still do.”

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As Christians, we are called to be a reflection of God's love on earth. This means caring for others and finding ways to serve them. Our church is a family, and we should support one another by offering help, guidance, and prayer. We must remember that to love God means to love our brothers and sisters.
                                <br>
                                “Anyone who does not provide for their relatives, and especially for their own household, has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.”

                                Effective communication is vital to our church community. We are a praying church that continually seeks God's direction, holding regular prayer meetings.

                                Creating a ‘Christian Culture’ within our church means embracing servanthood.

By fostering a culture of humility, kindness, and flexibility, we can achieve our vision and build a stronger, more united community.
